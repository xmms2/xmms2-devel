xmms2 news related to releases. History of user visible changes.

Version 0.9.2 DrPong (TODO)

Configuration changes:

* New --disable-valgrind option was added. Sometimes installed system
  `valgrind` is not capable of tracing binaries. This option disables
  use of `valgrind` without the need to uninstall it.

Bug fixes:

* The flac plugin was fixed to work with flac-1.4.0 decoder library.
  Before the fix some FLAC files were never finished decoding.

* The libvisual client render loop was extended to handle stopped
  playback thanks to Sebastian Pipping.

* The visualization client library now correctly detects shared memory
  support on linux. In xmms2-0.9.1 client always fell back to UDP.

* The visualization server side now opens both IPv4 and IPv6 UDP sockets
  if both are available. Previous versions sometimes opened IPv4-only or
  IPv6-only socket. Sometimes that did not match defaults from client
  side and visualization client did not work at all.

Version 0.9.1 DrPong (2022-05-02)

11 years since the previous xmms2 release. The git history has
accumulated over 600 commits.

Notable changes:

* Bundled waf was updated to version 2.0.22. It now requires python3.

* The ffmpeg plugin was updated to support upstream API changes.

* The medialib database backend switched from sqlite3 to s4, which was
  created specifically for xmms2.

  For typical xmms2 setups that run in home directories, the medialib
  migration will happen automatically: once the new version of `xmms2d`
  starts, it will convert the ~/.config/xmms2/medialib.db sqlite
  database to the ~/.config/xmms2/medialib.s4 s4 database by running the
  `sqlite2s4` tool.

  In daemon logs you should be able to find messages similar to the
  following:

    20:49:30  INFO ... Attempting to migrate database to new format
    20:46:30  INFO ... Migration successful.

  Conversion takes a while. While it happens, most operations on the
  medialib are blocked. For an example library of 30000 entries (~78MB
  medialib.db), it took 8 minutes to migrate to s4 on SSD. The
  conversion uses fsync() calls extensively and might take longer on
  HDD.

  Once the conversion is done, the sqlite database will move to
  ~/.config/xmms2/medialib.db.obsolete.

* The new `sqlite2s4` tool was added. `xmms2d` expects its presence in
  `PATH` to perform automatic medialib conversion to the s4 format.

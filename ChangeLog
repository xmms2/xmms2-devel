DR1.1 2004-06-01:
Tobias Rundström <tru@xmms.org>
	Fixed a bug that generated wrong contents of the pkg-config files.
	Fixed a bug where ringbuffer was created with size 0 if there was no configfile available.
	Fix bug #173, shuffle problems with playlist
	Fix bug #179, don't move entries outside the playlist.
	Start buffer the transport when waiting for the mimetype in import_playlist.
	Remove order clause in views. Added upgrade schemas, this means if you upgrade
	from v11 to v12 this will not destroy your medialib.
	Changed EnsureSCons version 0.96 since we seem to have problems with 0.95
	Don't start daemon if the plugin directory is unreadable.
	Initialize playlist and plugins in the right order. Could cause memory violation in rare cases.
	OSS plugin: Handle if open() returns --1.
	CLI: added mlib addall command for adding all files in medialib to the playlist
	CLI: changed key=value to key like value. To support wildcards in search.
	CLI: fixed a bug with searchadd that didn't check input correctly.
	CLI: Make searches non-case sensetive

Anders Gustafsson <andersg@xmms.org>
	Simplify m3u and pls plugins.
	Introduce a xmms_transport_read_line which reads one line from the transport.
	Make m3u and pls plugins use it.
	Avoid race by reffing transport before starting transport thread.
	Hold write_mutex while flushing, so its serialized wrt writes.
	Flush call moved from xmms_decoder_seek to xmms_output_seek.
	Remove seek-glitch.
	Move flush-on-stop call to output.c
	Use an own lock for serializing calls into plugin, instead of abusing write_lock.
	OSS: Remove mutex in oss, serialized at higher level now.
	OSS: Fix rates in oss plugins. (11025, not 12025)
	ALSA: Handle error from snd_pcm_avail_update in alsa.c
	ALSA: Make default alsamixer "default" not "hw:0"
	ALSA: Fix rates in alsa plugins. (11025, not 12025)
	ALSA: Don't change volume in open in alsa.c.
	BUG 180: Fix xmms_medialib_select to handle %s in query

Tilman Sauerbeck <tilman@code-monkey.de>
	Ruby bindings: added a bunch of methods to XmmsClient (bug #171).
	Ruby bindings: Removed XmmsClient#disconnect.
	Ruby bindings: Added XmmsClient#delete!
	Ruby bindings: exported some IO functions.
	Ruby bindings: Initialize XmmsClient's 'deleted' flag.
	Ruby bindings: Use StringValue() to check for strings instead of Check_Type().
	Ruby bindings: Fixed bug #185. Need to rb_require 'glib2' instead of 'glib'.
	CLI: remove doesn't accept invalid ids anymore.
	ALSA: Use longs instead of ints to store volume in ALSA since that's what ALSA uses internally.
	CLIENTLIB: Remove xmmsc_disconnect() declaration from xmmsclient.h since the function has been long removed.
	Bug #177, PlaylistEntries has entry as unique - won't allow more then one of the same entry in the playlist
	When we remove an entry from the playlist, 'currentpos' needs to be decreased if the current entry has been removed.
